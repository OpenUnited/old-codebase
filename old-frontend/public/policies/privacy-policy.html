      <h1>OpenUnited Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This document should be read in conjunction with our <a href="/policies/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a></p>
      <p>There are many different ways you can use our services - for example to find and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we are using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information to provide better services to our users.</p>
      <p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Information you give us.</strong> 
            <p>For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible profile, which may include your name and photo.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Information we obtain from your use of our services.</strong>
            <p>We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect OpenUnited and our users. We also use this information to offer you a tailored experience in using our services.</p>
      <p>When you contact OpenUnited, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
      <p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your location preferences in our LocalNote service, weâ€™ll be able to display locally relevant content.</p>
      <p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other OpenUnited services.</p>
      <p>OpenUnited processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
      <h2>Choice</h2>
      <p>You may decide to set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services. However, it is important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your location or other preferences.</p>
      <h2>Information you share</h2>
      <p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines and other online services.</p>
      <h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
      <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it â€“ unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
      <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
      <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Therefore after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
      <h2>Information we share</h2>
      <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of OpenUnited unless one of the following circumstances apply:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>With your consent</strong>
            <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of OpenUnited when we have your consent to do so.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>For external processing</strong>
                  <p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>For legal reasons</strong>
                  <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of OpenUnited if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
                     <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
                     <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                     <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of OpenUnited, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with our partners - like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
            <h2>Information security</h2>
            <p>We strive to protect OpenUnited and our users from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
               <li>We restrict access to personal information to OpenUnited employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Application</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by OpenUnited, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may include OpenUnited services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organisations who advertise our services, or advertise within our services.</p>
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. You should look at this policy and our <a href="/policies/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> regularly. If you do not agree to the modified terms or privacy policies for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
